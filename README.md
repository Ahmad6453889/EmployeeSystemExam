This exam is an Employee Management System API built using .NET Core 8 and Entity Framework Core with a code-first approach. To set up the project, follow these steps:
Update Database Configuration: Open the appsettings.json file and modify the DefaultConnection string with your database server details.
Apply Migrations: Execute the dotnet ef database update command(update-databese)in the terminal to create the database schema based on the code-first approach.
Than Project is ready to run,  I use swagger API documentation for this.
